### *Squalicorax* a cretaceous lamniformes

## Abstract

The purposes of the several script I intended to write were to give a fast and comprehensive way for mitogenomic datamining, and giving the user a fasta way to obtain a maximum likelyhood phylogeny.
One must understand that this only on UNIX system.
Also this pipeline remain highly experimental so I understand that many uppgrade can be conducted.
Finally, this programm automatised the vast majority of datamining, but several steps of check must be conducted unless you don't mind having a messy alingment and a messier phylogeny at the end.

## Prerequisite

To work the masterscript need the user to have installated the following programms:

  - ENTREZ DIRECT 
  - muscle
  - Emboss
  - python3
  - iqtree2
  - seqkit
 
  *ONLY for MS2.sh*
  - Manually download one reference genome whose purpose is to adjust the size of the incomplete sequence, and put it into a newly created folder called "reference".
  
## Getting started

Along the instruction we are going to study two ways to obtain a phylogeny for the following specie dataset :

*Prionace glauca* (Carcharhiniformes)

*Carcharodon carcharias* (Lamniformes)

*Rhincodon typus* (Orectolobiformes)

*Squatina squatina* (Squatiniformes)

*Hexanchus griseus* (Hexanchiformes)

*Squalus acanthias* (Squaliformes)

*Heterodontus zebra* (Heterodontiformes)

![Heterodontus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80922475/154269004-fa41a2ae-d9fd-4f94-89f8-80692ffda38d.jpg)

*Pristiophorus japonicus* (Pristiophoriformes)

![Pristiophorus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80922475/154267653-33117072-f8c0-4748-bd18-8cf061fd1df5.jpg)

First the user must specify a species list into your current directory. The list is call list.txt and you must specify the species name in the same way that in the following example :

Two master script are presented here:

## I Fast phylo

  The first one is the quickest of the two and lack many steps of checking but remain the best way to have a quick and dirty phylogeny.
  One must pay attention to the data availabilty, because the code will function only for species with refseq mitogenome.
  
  To start the script, the user have just to run the following command line in the directory downloaded from this git : bash QD.sh
  
  At the you will find several file corresponding to the output of Iqtree, comprising a contree.file in the "last" folder, which is the consensus tree from the maximum likelyhood analysis.
  
  I higly recomand the use of figtree as a tree visualizer for the consensus tree as seen in this example

## II Complete phylo
  
  The second script is by far the slowest of the two but is far more complex and can handle even incomplete data.
  As such it is not a problem for the user to specify in the list even missing species, because the script will automaticaly remove them.
  
  ### a) First step : datamining, first cleaning and consensus
  
  To avoid most errors the second master script is in fact divided onto three subscript, here we examine the first one called "first_step.sh"
  First the subscript will also download mitogenomic data for the specify species in the list, but will be not only restricted to refseq genome.
  
  Extanding the spectrum of available sequence will largely benefit our dataset since most of the sequence of genbank will be either non complete or non-refseq. 
  
  Since multiple sequence will be downloaded for each specie, we will have to choose one among all of them, but can't really know *a priori* which one is the best. We then decided to make a consensus sequence (by calling em_cons) each time multiple sequence were available for the same gene in one specie. Nevertheless scarce error can happen when constituing consensus sequence. The default behavior of the script is to keep the largest sequence among the others as the "backup" sequence, and by doing so missing data (due to either bad consensus or bad alignement) will be replaced by the backup sequence.
  Also the script will easily complete sequence with missing data (typically barcode sequence) with N.
  At the end of the script the name of the gene and specie  will be dispalyed into the terminal. Those names correspond to messy sequence, and need to be monitored manualy. In my experience the messy data are the one from either non-specified reverse complement in the genbank database or contaminated sequence from an other gene/or specie. The fastest way to get rid of this is to replace those problematic sequence by N placeholder generated from the reference directory, but the best way remain to manually complete these sequence by hand and/or to use their reverse-complement.
  
  ### b) Second step : alignement
  
    The second step is the alignement of our sequences, and the sorting of our sequence, which is by far the most time-consumming of all.
    The script will automatically align all the sequence by gene. The programm called here is muscle, but several other alignement programm exist, such as Macse or Clustalw. In the future version of the script I will certainly be using Macse instead of muscle for coding sequence. Even if this process is stil automatized one must check by hand the quality of the alignement. Indeed a messy alignement will result into a phylogeny with abnormally large branch length.
